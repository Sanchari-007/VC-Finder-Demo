## üöÄ Project Overview

This project is a web-based platform developed as a technical qualification task. It demonstrates the ability to create an application that allows users to input an industry and subsequently identify Venture Capitalists (VCs) specializing in that sector. The platform is designed to display comprehensive VC profiles, including what are designed to appear as highly accurate and validated email addresses (within the synthetic data context).

The primary goal was to deliver a high-quality, functional, and responsive web application, showcasing proficiency in modern web development practices and efficient project execution.

## ‚ú® Features

  * **Industry-Based VC Search:** Users can input a specific industry (e.g., "automotive", "fintech", "fashion") to find relevant VCs.
  * **VC Profile Display:** Presents detailed profiles for identified VCs.
  * **"Highly Accurate" Email Addresses:** The platform displays email addresses, simulating the "validated" aspect requested in the task.
  * **Responsive Design:** Optimized for seamless viewing and interaction across various devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).
  * **Intuitive User Interface:** Clean and modern design for an excellent user experience.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

This application is built with a powerful and modern technology stack:

  * **Frontend Framework:** [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (React Framework for Production)
  * **Styling:** [Tailwind CSS v3](https://tailwindcss.com/) (A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development)
  * **Data Storage (for deployed version):** [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) (used as the backend database to store the synthetic AI-generated data).
  * **Deployment:** [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Data Disclaimer

**Please note:** This web application is built *for demonstration purposes using synthetic data generated by AI*. All names, contact details, and other information related to VCs and their profiles are entirely fictional. Any resemblance to real persons or entities is purely coincidental, and the developer is not responsible for any such similarities. The "highly accurate and validated email addresses" are a *feature of the synthetic data* to showcase the intended functionality per the task's requirements.

## üåê Live Demo

Experience the platform with full dynamic data by visiting the live deployment:
[**[[VC-Finder-Platform](https://vc-finder-demo.vercel.app/)]**]

## üöÄ Getting Started (Local Development)

To run the frontend application locally, follow these simple steps. Note that the full dynamic data capabilities (as seen on the live demo) rely on a backend database which is not configured in this local setup for security and simplicity.

### Prerequisites

  * Node.js (LTS version recommended)
  * npm or Yarn

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Run the development server:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    ```

4.  **Open in browser:**
    Open [http://localhost:3000](https://www.google.com/search?q=http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the application. The local version will display the frontend structure and styling, potentially with limited hardcoded dummy data for basic functionality demonstration if implemented.

## ‚è±Ô∏è Development Process & Time Commitment

This project was completed within a total of **5 hours**. The development embraced a **"Vibe Coding" methodology**, prioritizing quick implementation and iterative refinement to meet the tight deadline, also demonstrating a commitment to efficient development and rapid prototyping.

* **1 Hour:** Knowledge gathering and understanding of the task requirements.
* **2 Hours:** Core coding, implementing UI with Tailwind CSS, and initial data integration.
* **2 Hours:** Debugging, testing responsiveness, and deployment to Vercel.
